This is a simple iOS application to show a list of all the Miami University builidings. 
Clicking on one of the building names will  show it in Google Maps.

This app is meant for local use:
To get walking directions from your current location to a building first find and click it in the table view.
Once the map view has loaded click the "Route" button at the top left.

At any time when the network connection is lost a a full-screen message will appear. 
This is because the app can not function without a network connection.
